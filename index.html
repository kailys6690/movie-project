        <h1>The Brawl Between Xavier and Kaily</h1>
    <p>Everyday at school, Xavier dreaded going to his 5th period class: Software Engineer. Not because the class was boring, but because who he had to next to in that class. Meet Kaily. Kaily Sanchez. The most annoying girl in class who is constatnly bothering whoever is around her. Everytime he arrived to class, Kaily gave him the evil-eye and stared him down. She was the type of person to ANNOY a person until she got tired (which was rare). All Xavier wanted was to avoid that class was because he knew that he would be iritated by her. So he comes up with some plans to figure out his problem. Coming out never.</p>
