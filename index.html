        <p> Everyday at school, Xavier dreaded going to his 5th period class: Software Engineer. Not because the class was boring, but because who he had to next to in that class. Meet Kaily. Kaily Sanchez. The most annoying girl in class who is constatnly
            bothering whoever is around her. Everytime he arrived to class, Kaily gave him the evil-eye and stared him down. She would bother him that whole period and constatnly distract him from doing his class work. Eventually he finally had enough
            of this, so he decides to take a stand and declares a brawl against her!</p>
